# I've been learning Jetpack Compose 
and recently put my skills to use by crafting a recipe app UI. 
Within this project, I created the DetailsActivity.kt for users to delve into detailed recipe information, 
while the HomeScreen.kt acts as the central hub featuring recipe lists and search functionality. 
Additionally, I developed a reusable RecipeCard component to display individual recipes and implemented a BottomMenuContent for intuitive app navigation. 
This endeavor not only reinforced my understanding of Jetpack Compose but also resulted in a seamless user experience, 
enabling users to effortlessly explore and engage with recipes within the app.
